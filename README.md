# No SQL Social Network

## Description
This project was created to further understand how to create a database without the help of mySQL. By using mongoose, we are able to create a thought database and a reaction database easily. 

## Installation
We would have to run an npm i in order to install mongoose and express. In order to get the server to start we would run the command "node server.js" or "npm start"

## Usage
This program is intended to replicate the workings of a social network where users can post their thoughts and have other people reply to them. A new user with a new thought can be created along with new thoughts and new replies. All these aspects also have their very own unique ID that is used in the program to manipulate through all the GETS,POSTS,PUTS and DELETES.
